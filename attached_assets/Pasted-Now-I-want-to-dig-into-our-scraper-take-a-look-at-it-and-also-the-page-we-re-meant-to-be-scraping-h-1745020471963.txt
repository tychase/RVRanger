Now I want to dig into our scraper. take a look at it and also the page we're meant to be scraping https://www.prevost-stuff.com/forsale/public_list_ads.php 
We want the title to omit "Prevost" and include the year, converter, and chasis. So if you look at https://www.prevost-stuff.com/2009PrevostLibertyH_TMS2523041825.html It should pull "2009 Liberty Elegant Lady H3-45 Double Slide"

You’ve got two jobs ahead:

Clean up the title in your scraper so it strips out “Prevost” and grabs the full, human‑readable name from the detail page (where things like “Elegant Lady” live).

Omit “Prevost” and only surface year + converter + model + chassis + slides in your JSON.

1. How the listing page vs. detail page differ
Listing page (public_list_ads.php) shows truncated links like

Edit
2009 Prevost Parliament XLII Double Slide
Detail page (2009PrevostLibertyH_TMS2523041825.html) typically contains the full name, e.g.

css
Copy

2009 Prevost Liberty Elegant Lady H3-45 Double Slide
To get “2009 Liberty Elegant Lady H3-45 Double Slide” you need to:

Follow the link to the detail URL.

Parse the main headline there (often in an <h2>, <h1> or other prominent tag).

Remove the word “Prevost” from that string.

2. Patch for improved_rv_scraper.py
Below is a minimal snippet showing how to pull the full title from the detail page and clean it up. Insert this in place of your current title-extraction logic:

python
Copy
Edit
import re
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# … inside your loop, where you have detail_url for each listing …

# 1) Fetch and parse the detail page
detail_res = requests.get(detail_url, timeout=10)
detail_soup = BeautifulSoup(detail_res.text, "html.parser")

# 2) Extract the headline (adjust selector to your page)
#    Try looking at devtools to confirm the tag – here I'm guessing <h2>
headline_tag = detail_soup.find("h2") or detail_soup.find("h1")
raw_title = headline_tag.get_text(strip=True) if headline_tag else title_from_list_page

# 3) Strip out "Prevost" (case‑insensitive)
#    And collapse extra whitespace
clean_title = re.sub(r"\bPrevost\b", "", raw_title, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
clean_title = " ".join(clean_title.split())

# 4) (Optional) Ensure year stays at front
#    If you want to force the year to always lead:
year_match = re.match(r"^(\d{4})", clean_title)
if year_match:
    year = year_match.group(1)
    rest = clean_title[len(year):].strip()
    clean_title = f"{year} {rest}"

# Now use `clean_title` for your JSON output
listing["title"] = clean_title
What this does:
Follows the detail link (so you capture “Elegant Lady” etc.)

Finds the main heading (<h2> or <h1>) on that page

Removes the standalone word “Prevost” via regex

Collapses any double‑spaces

Re‑prefixes the 4‑digit year so titles always begin with the year

3. Verify & Roll Out
Run the modified scraper on a single URL to confirm it now spits out:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"2009 Liberty Elegant Lady H3-45 Double Slide"
Import that into your DB and spot‑check the rv_listings.title column.

Scale up to more listings once you’re satisfied.

With that in place, all your cards and search results will show a clean, no‑“Prevost” title that highlights exactly what your buyer cares about. Let me know how it goes!
